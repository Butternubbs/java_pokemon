/**
 * This class is a log or list of things to do.
 * 
 * MAIN OBJECTIVE: Implement all Gen 1 Monsters and moves for those Monsters.
 * 1. Test if everything works, fix accordingly.
 * 
 * 2. There is a damage effector, based on randomness, which should multiply damage by
 * 0.85-1.0. This can be implemented in the MoveMethods 'TypeDamage' methods.
 * 
 * 3. AMBITIOUS: Create a system that allows for teams of up to six Monsters to be used.
 * This should rely on Monster arrays, and the Monster should be able to be switched out
 * in sacrifice of a move for that turn. The values of the Monster that is being called 
 * should replace the ones of the current Monster on the 'battlefield'.
 * -Figure out a way to apply this system to the opponent as well. Should the opponent send
 * out a random Monster, or should it be predetermined by the player's input?
 * 
 * 4. AMBITIOUS, OPTIMIZATION: Create a database (text file?) that holds the values of
 * every predetermined Monster in a vertical list, and is able to be read by the program
 * (instead  of integrating all of these values directly into the code). This will cut down
 * significantly on the size of the 'name' method in the 'Name' class.
 * 
 * 5. OPTIMIZATION: Create methods that cut down the bulk of the battle turn system.
 * Perhaps this could be done for move selection of the player and opponent.
